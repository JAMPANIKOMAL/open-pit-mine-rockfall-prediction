    "A core challenge in mining analytics is the lack of public, high-quality data. Real-world geotechnical sensor data is proprietary and rarely shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we will create a **high-fidelity synthetic dataset** for this project. This approach gives us full control to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Ensure Logical Soundness:** All features are relevant to rockfall prediction.\n",
    "2.  **Engineer Statistical Realism:** \"Driver\" features like `rainfall` and `seismic_activity` are modeled on the statistical properties of real-world Kaggle datasets.\n",
    "3.  **Build Purposeful Complexity:** We will create built-in correlations and logical rules, providing a rich, complex dataset for our DAV analysis."
