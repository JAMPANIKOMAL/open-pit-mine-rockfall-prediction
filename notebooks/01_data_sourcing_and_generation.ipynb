    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of any analytics project is its data. A significant challenge in mining analytics is the lack of public, high-quality data, as real-world geotechnical sensor data is proprietary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, this notebook creates a **high-fidelity synthetic dataset**. We will follow a professional workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sourcing:** We will load and analyze two real-world Kaggle datasets (one for rainfall, one for seismic activity) to understand their statistical properties.\n",
    "2.  **Generation:** We will use these real-world properties as our \"recipe\" to build a new, clean dataset of 20,000 samples.\n",
    "3.  **Logic:** We will engineer purposeful, complex relationships between the features to create a rich dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's final output is the `rockfall_synthetic_data.csv` file, which will be the foundation for the entire project."
